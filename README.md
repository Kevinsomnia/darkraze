My old tactical sci-fi first person shooter created in Unity. This codebase version of the project contains no game assets. If you want to see what the ACTUAL game looks like, check the YouTube link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoTc4aVz7z4

## This isn't a Unity project. How can I play it?
To avoid copyright issues, I removed all paid assets from the Unity Asset Store. Unfortunately, one of these assets controls the user interface. As you can tell, a game without a user interface can be quite difficult to use.

Without these assets, you cannot play the game within the Unity Editor. **However, I have included the latest working builds in the Releases section.**

Ultimately, the purpose of this repository is so that you can see how certain features in the game were coded. **This by no means represents the programmer I am today. Most of the code that you are looking at was written back in 2014.**

## The code references things that don't exist in this repository.
These libraries were either written by someone else other than me, or it was a paid Unity asset that was stripped out (as mentioned above).
